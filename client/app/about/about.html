                    {{ "This is a campaign designed by #osmIRL or OpenStreetMap Ireland CLG, which is the chapter organization for the OpenStreetMap Community in Ireland. The background to the campaign is based on a discussion at the 2019 AGM in Dublin where the community asked the chapter organization to devise a shared project that would allow the community connect together again and share a mission like we did successfully with the townlands project. The additional criteria were set which were that the mission should have a low bar of complexity for new members, and that it should also address a major missing feature on the map on both sides of the border. The board members worked on this for several months and opted for  #osmIRL_buildings because:" | translate }}

                <ul>
                    <li>Only about 20% of Irelandâ€™s buildings were mapped at the end of 2019</li>
                    <li>Mapping buildings is a relatively straightforward task, as observed with hotosm activiations in the developing world</li>
                    <li>A more detailed buildings set is scalable, can be extracted in clusters to infer landuses, can support more complete addressing efforts, can be used to detect unspotted roadways, can be used to make a more complete range of street-level commercial services</li>
                </ul>
                
                <p>
                    Other osm communities have spotted the importance of mapping buildings as a lever to complete their map. 
                    Examples of these are communities are 
                    <a href="https://osm-austria-building-coverage.thomaskonrad.at/">Austria</a> and 
                    <a href="https://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/Canada/Building_Canada_2020">Canada</a>. 
                    These example campaigns have several years of a head-start on #osmIRL_buildings, and the osm communities in those countries 
                    have visible benefits of a larger mapper participation base about 4 to 5 times that for Ireland, as well as a more complete map, 
                    and a plurality of mapping projects assisted by the building traces.

                        OpenStreetMap in Ireland will organize mapathons and meetups to assist contributors to the #osmIRL_buildings campaign. 
                        All mappers will follow the osmf recommended

                    <p>
                        telegram group is in operation which will be used to have common issues discussions about matters that face all mappers, 
                        but individual feedback will not be done in public, instead the hotosm task manager is the sole place to discuss mistakes 
                        or misunderstandings about specific changesets and contributions.

                        Occasionally the campaign may ne mentioned on other for a, the message board, IRC, twitter and facebook, but active contributors are asked to keep their dicussions in telegram and their feedback on the task manager tool.
